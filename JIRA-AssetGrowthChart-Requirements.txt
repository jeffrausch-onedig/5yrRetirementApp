=====================================================

TICKET ID: RPA-001
PROJECT: 5-Year Retirement Plan Evaluation App
COMPONENT: Financial Projections Module
PRIORITY: High

2. Support for 4 distinct scenarios: Current Plan, Optimized, 10% Contribution, Auto-Enrollment
3. Interactive tooltips showing exact balance values at each data point
4. Responsive design that works on mobile devices for client presentations
5. Professional styling consistent with app design system
6. Export capability for client reports
7. Real-time updates when input parameters change

- Memory usage: < 10MB for chart instance
- Browser compatibility: Modern browsers (ES6+ support)

CALCULATION SPECIFICATIONS
--------------------------

### Core Financial Model
**Monthly Compounding Formula:**
```
Monthly Return Rate = Annual Return Rate / 12
Monthly Balance Growth = Previous Balance * (1 + Monthly Return Rate)
```

### Contribution Calculations
**Employee Contributions:**
```javascript
monthlyEmployeeContrib = (employeeContribRate / 100) * avgSalary / 12
```

**Employer Contributions:**
```javascript
monthlyEmployerContrib = (employerContribRate / 100) * avgSalary / 12
```

**Employer Match Calculation:**
```javascript
maxMatchPerMonth = (employer401kMatch / 100) * avgSalary / 12
actualMatchPerMonth = maxMatchPerMonth * (matchUtilization / 100)
```

### Scenario-Specific Logic

#### Current Plan Scenario
- Uses actual employee contribution rate from form input
- Uses actual match utilization percentage
- Baseline scenario for comparisons

#### Optimized Scenario
- Employee contribution rate = employer match rate (maximize free money)
- Match utilization = 100% (assume perfect education)
- Represents ideal engagement with current plan design

#### 10% Contribution Scenario
- Fixed 10% employee contribution rate (retirement planning best practice)
- Enhanced match utilization = min(100%, current + 30%)
- Models common financial advisor recommendation

#### Auto-Enrollment Scenario
- If current plan uses opt-in: contribution rate = default auto-enroll rate (3%)
- If current plan uses auto-enroll: enhanced rate = current rate * 1.2
- Match utilization boost = current utilization * 1.8 (capped at 100%)
- Models behavioral impact of auto-enrollment

### Auto-Escalation Logic
```javascript
if (autoEscalation && year > 0 && currentRate < maxRate) {
    currentEmployeeRate = Math.min(currentRate + 1, maxAutoEscalationRate)
}
```

### Fee Impact Calculations
**Annual Fee Allocation:**
```javascript
// Investment fees always paid by employees
annualFeesPerEmployee = investmentFee

// Other fees based on allocation setting
if (feesPaidBy === 'employee') {
    annualFeesPerEmployee += recordKeeperFee + advisorFee + tpaFee + auditFee
} else if (feesPaidBy === 'split') {
    annualFeesPerEmployee += (recordKeeperFee + advisorFee + tpaFee + auditFee) / 2
}

// Per-participant fee impact
annualFeePerPerson = participants > 0 ? annualFeesPerEmployee / participants : 0
```

### Monthly Calculation Loop
```javascript
for (let year = 0; year <= 25; year++) {
    for (let month = 0; month < 12; month++) {
        // Add monthly contributions
        currentBalance += monthlyEmployeeContrib + monthlyEmployerContrib + monthlyMatchContrib
        
        // Apply monthly investment return
        monthlyGrowth = currentBalance * monthlyReturnRate
        currentBalance += monthlyGrowth
    }
    
    // Deduct annual fees at year end
    currentBalance -= annualFeePerPerson
}
```

VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------
1. Balance values must be non-negative
2. Contribution rates must be within 0-100% range
3. Investment returns must be positive
4. Fee calculations must account for participant count > 0
5. Auto-escalation cannot exceed specified maximum rate
6. Match calculations cannot exceed salary-based limits

ERROR HANDLING
--------------
- Invalid input parameters: Display user-friendly error messages
- Calculation overflow: Implement bounds checking
- Chart rendering failures: Graceful degradation with error state
- Missing data: Use sensible defaults with user notification

TESTING REQUIREMENTS
--------------------
- Unit tests for all calculation functions
- Integration tests for chart rendering
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile responsive testing
- Performance testing with large datasets
- Edge case testing (zero values, extreme inputs)

DEPENDENCIES
------------
- Chart.js library (CDN)
- Modern browser with Canvas support
- JavaScript ES6+ features
- HTML5 form validation APIs

DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------
- Inline code comments for complex calculations
- JSDoc documentation for public functions
- README section explaining calculation methodology
- User guide for interpreting chart results

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Security: Input validation, XSS prevention
- Performance: Sub-second response times
- Scalability: Handle plans up to 10,000 participants
- Maintainability: Modular, well-documented code

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
--------------------
The asset growth chart serves as the primary visualization for demonstrating retirement plan value propositions to clients. The calculation engine must be mathematically accurate and align with industry-standard retirement planning methodologies. Special attention should be paid to the behavioral modeling aspects, as these differentiate the application from basic financial calculators.

The chart component should integrate seamlessly with the existing form validation system and maintain state consistency across navigation between different analysis views.
